# MERN-stack-
MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Node). Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code)- Content Management System or a basic Social Network API

Some issues that i had to solve in this project------->


✔️ server.js file was trying to execute the data base before the variables of the env load the proccess
-----------------------------------------
   ✅ Solution = reorder the dotenv code line:
   require('dotenv').config(); (This line should be the first onee in the "server.js" file)
   (this had to be the very first line in the code)
-----------------------------------------

✔️Make sure the file .env is writed ✅"MONGODB_URI" instead "MONGODB_URL"
------------------------------------------

✔️ Other 
MongoDB connection failed: bad auth : authentication failed
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...

this was for a problem in the database "user pasword"needed to be updated and repaced in the .env file... 
RESULT:
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://webartistdesign_db_user:*NewPasswordHere*@oscardb.uhazsl9.mongodb.net/


--------------------------------------------------
✔️ Other 
Postman had troubles Posting my json file because the actual IP adress needed to be Update in mongo db atlas 
under / Security/Data Base and Network Acess/ IP Access List
Issue solved ✅ We got the post! (I think it was my antivirus VPN)

**Nodemon acualize the changes in the .js files automatically so that was a big help**
**sing MongoDB for VS Code extention for vscode was helpfull too**
